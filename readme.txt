DATA FOLDER HAS BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION TO MAKE GITHUB PUSH POSSIBLE.
    TO RUN THIS CODE:
    STEP 1: CREATE a 'data' FOLDER. CREATE 3 MORE FOLDERS INSIDE THAT: 'raw', 'ready', 'mid'. PUT YOUR DATASET FILES IN JSON.GZ IN THE 'raw' FOLDER.
    STEP 2: CHANGE 'config.json' AS PER YOUR REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING NAME OF THE DATASET AND UID/IID COUNT. MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES IN 'entry.py' BASED ON THESE CHANGES.
    STEP 3: RUN 'run.slurm' FILE TO RUN ON HOPPER USING 'entry.py' WITH MID AND READY SET TO 1 TO PREPARE THE DATASET. ONCE FINISHED, RUN 'entry.py' WITH OTHER PARAMETERS. PARAMETERS ALREADY EXIST IN THE SLURM FILE. JUST UNCOMMENT THEM.
    STEP 4: THE RESULTS WILL BE STORED IN THE OUTPUT FILE SPECIFIED IN THE SLURM FILE AND USER-BASED MAE/RMSE CALCULATIONS WILL BE STORED IN ./results_cs798/.
